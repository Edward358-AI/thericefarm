<h1>Welcome.</h1>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>
  The universe is collapsing. More importantly, your galaxy is collapsing. And you are stuck in the middle of it. You need a ship with an extremely advanced and powerful propulsion system to escape to the outer reaches and begin your journey once again. However, you are just a lowly rice farmer. How far could you possible get? So far, no one in the universe has succeeded in the researching of this propulsion system. Will be the first to ascend to the top? I don't know. The stars await an answer. And you are the only one who can provide it to them. So, go farming, Peasant, and we shall meet again soon.
</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
  To get started, you'll need some simple supplies to begin farming your way up to the top. You are given a small amount of rice, water, fertilizer, and money. You must build your way up to the top via farming, harvesting, and trading. To farm, you must click on the tile. To harvest, you must click on the tile again, after it is ready. There is a market ready for you to sell, buy, and possibly trade things. Our currency is yuan. We wouldn't have it any other way.
</p>
<h3>Mid-game</h3>
<p>
  (At XP level 20...) So we meet again. I actually didn't think you would make it this far. You have come a long way from your humble beginnings, as a tiny little peasant, with a tiny bit of land and supplies. Yet time runs low. Your galaxy is still collapsing. You must now accept your fate and begin the research phase. You have acquired the skill of collecting research as you farm, and gaining powerful and useful knowledge. Good luck. You'll need this research. Before you lies three huge steps that you must take to reach your final end goal. A unique award awaits you at the end of each stage.<br>Step 1: Before you can start working on the propulsion system, you'll need to learn basic physics and mechanics. These sets of experiments and concepts will require you 1,000 research and 100元.<br>Step 2: I know you are excited to continue, but you must now learn the concept of nuclear propulsion. It is rather powerful and useful in many facets, but is rather primitive in the speed category. Still, it is an important concept to know about, and you'll need it later on. To acquire this, you will need 10,000 research, 1,000元, and 200 select rice seeds, for the select rice is said to be extremely unstable (it's still safe to eat though).<br>Step 3: This is the final and most important step. You will now learn that the universe contains dimensions beyond the thinkable. You will learn to (literally) bend and distort these dimensions and use that to your advantage. This is the concept of curvature propulsion (a term coined by Liu Cixin), and this will require a grand cost of 50,000 research. In addition, it will also cost you 50,000元 (for ship materials), 500 brown rice seeds, and 1 gold seed to finish the final step.
</p>
<h3>Other Uses of Research</h3>
<p>
  Your research is not only limited to researching curvature propulsion. You can also use it to advance your own farming. For example, for 100 brown rice seeds and 2,000 research, you can increase the amount of brown mutations you get when using select seeds. For 100 brown rice seeds and 5,000 research, you can increase the amount of gold mutations that happen when using brown seeds. The technology for a more powerful fertilizer can be unlocked with 1,000 research and 200 fertilizer. Hope this will assist you in your journey to finally building that ship.
